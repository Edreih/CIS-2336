## CIS 2336
During the Spring 2017 semester I took CIS 2336 (Internet Application Development) with Professor Natalia Fofanova at the University of Houston.

This course provided an introduction to client and server side technologies. Client side technologies learned include HTML for structure, CSS for presentation and JavasScript for interactivity. Server-side technologies include PHP for middleware and MySQL for dynamic web applications.

This website is a showcase of what I've learned and displays my top assignments for each class module.
